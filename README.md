## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Nick
I write code, sometimes it works. I'm currently using a (mostly) web-based tech stack, but I'm looking to branch out in the future! I'm a big fan of privacy &  open-source software, so most of my projects reflect that!

If you'd like to contact me, I have some links on [my website](https://nchristopher.me). You can also email me directly at [nchristopher@tuta.io](mailto:nchristopher@tuta.io).
