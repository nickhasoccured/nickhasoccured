<h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I make [random stuff](https://github.com/nickhasoccured?tab=repositories) which are useful to me or (_hopefully_) useful to others. Web-based languages are where I'm at right now, but I'll probably branch out in the future.

Pretty much everything I do is open-source and freely licensed! If you'd like to contact me, I have some links on [my website](https://nchristopher.me).
