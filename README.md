## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Nick

I make open-source software for the internet. My projects aim to be useful to me or (_hopefully_) useful to others. Iâ€™m currently using web-based languages, but Iâ€™m looking to branch out in the future!

**Here are some of the projects I'm working on:**

-   [**Quoter**](https://github.com/nchristopher/quoter) - a Discord bot which stores quotes for servers & retrieves them on demand. It supports listing, (randomly) displaying, deleting, and editing quotes!
-   [**PPS Credentials**](https://github.com/nchristopher/pps-credentials) - a tool for PPS students to generate default credentials for their account.
-   [**AutoPublisher**](https://github.com/nchristopher/autopublisher) - a simple Discord bot that automatically publishes messages in announcement channels.

If you'd like to contact me, I have some links on [my website](https://nchristopher.me). You can also email me directly at [nchristopher@tuta.io](mailto:nchristopher@tuta.io).
