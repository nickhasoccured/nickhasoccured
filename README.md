## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Nick
I write code, sometimes it works. I'm currently using a (mostly) web-based tech stack, but I'm looking to branch out in the future! I'm a big fan of privacy &  open-source software, so most of my projects reflect that:

-   [**Quoter**](https://github.com/nchristopher/quoter) - a Discord bot which stores quotes for servers & retrieves them on demand. It supports listing, (randomly) displaying, deleting, and editing quotes!
-   [**PPS Credentials**](https://github.com/nchristopher/pps-credentials) - a tool for PPS students to generate default credentials for their account.
-   [**AutoPublisher**](https://github.com/nchristopher/autopublisher) - a simple Discord bot that automatically publishes messages in announcement channels.

If you'd like to contact me, I have some links on [my website](https://nchristopher.me). You can also email me directly at [nchristopher@tuta.io](mailto:nchristopher@tuta.io).
