## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Nick

I make [random things](https://github.com/nickhasoccured?tab=repositories) which are useful to me or (hopefully) to others. Everything I do is open-source and freely licensed!

**Here are some of the projects I'm working on:**

-   [**Quoter**](https://github.com/nickhasoccured/quoter) - a Discord bot which stores quotes for servers & retrieves them on demand. It supports listing, (randomly) displaying, deleting, and editing quotes!
-   [**PPS Credentials**](https://github.com/nickhasoccured/pps-credentials) - a tool for PPS students to generate default credentials for their account.
-   [**AutoPublisher**](https://github.com/nickhasoccured/autopublisher) - a simple Discord bot that automatically publishes messages in announcement channels.

I'm mainly using JavaScript/Node.js at the moment, but I'm looking to branch out in the future!

If you'd like to contact me, I have some links on [my website](https://nchristopher.me). You can also email me directly at [nchristopher@tuta.io](mailto:nchristopher@tuta.io).
